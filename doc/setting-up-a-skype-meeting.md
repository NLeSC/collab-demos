# Instructions for setting up a Skype meeting.


## From the Windows 8 Machine

- On the desktop, there is an icon _Skype for Business_ (there's also  'normal' Skype, but you should use Skype for business if you can); 
- Start Skype for Business and log in as user **collab&#64;esciencecenter.nl** using the same password as for logging into the Windows 10 machine itself; the credentials are posted [here](https://nlesc.sharepoint.com/it/SitePages/Collab.aspx).
- Skype for Business has been configured to use the microphone/speaker combination and videocamera that are present in the room. The microphone/speaker combination is called _Chat50_, while the videocamera is called _Logitech &lt;something or other&gt;_. You should not need to change this.
- On the _Advanced_ tab of the Crestron screen (or the iPad), make sure that 
  - you have enabled audio for the _Windows 8_ machine (if you did, there should be a green circle next to _Windows 8_ in the _Advanced_ tab)
  - the Logitech camera is actually out of its cubbyhole (you can do this by pressing _Lift camera_ in the _Advanced_ tab)


## From your own laptop
