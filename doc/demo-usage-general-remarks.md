Most developers use Google Chrome as their main browser during development of a web demo, so that browser is least likely to give you unexpected behavior.

All webdemos require internet access. Note that this is true even when you have a local copy of all the demo code&mdash;this is because the webdemos rely on additional JavaScript libraries (e.g. [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), [lodash](https://lodash.com/), [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)) that are typically downloaded when you start the webdemo.

Some webdemos have additional requirements. These are explained below.
