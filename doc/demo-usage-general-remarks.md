Most developers use Google Chrome as their main browser during development of a web demo, so that browser is least likely to give you unexpected behavior.

All webdemos require internet access. Note that this is true even when you do a _clone_ of all the demo code (see [here](./installing-github-desktop-on-windows.md) for a description of how to clone a repository on Windows); this is because the webdemos rely on additional JavaScript libraries that are typically downloaded when you start the webdemo.

Some webdemos have additional requirements, for example with regard to: IP-whitelisting, credentials, or GPU. These are explained below.
