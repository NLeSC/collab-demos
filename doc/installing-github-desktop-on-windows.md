Let's say you want to get a local copy of this repository. There is a ``Download ZIP`` button on the [main](~) website, but that does curently not give you all the files in the repository (it skips the larger files, which are stored in [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/)). Fortunately, there is a relatively simple solution:

1. Download and install GitHub Desktop from [http://desktop.github.com/](http://desktop.github.com/)
3. Start the application by clicking the icon on your desktop
4. Login with your GitHub credentials
5. In the upper left corner of the application, click the '+' sign button
6. At the top of the dialog, there are 3 options, ``Add``, ``Create``, and ``Clone``. Select ``Clone``
7. You now see your repositories
8. Select ``collab-demos``
9. Wait for the download to finish
