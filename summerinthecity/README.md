# general idea



# usage

This demo is a publicly accessible web demo. That means you should be able to access it with your browser as long as you have a working internet connection.

## quirks
- vector overlay only specified for certain zoom levels. If you zoom out too much, you see only 'gemeentes' without color information on heat; zoom in too much and you see only houses.



# technologically interesting aspects

- bringing together various data sources
  - kadaster (what building is located where?)
  - [AHN](http://ahn.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=c3c98b8a4ff84ff4938fafe7cc106e88) (what is the local surface elevation of the landscape (including objects such as buildings, trees, etc)?
  -  aerial photography (how green is a given area?)
  -  _citizen science_: [Weather Underground](http://www.wunderground.com/) observations
  -  Wageningen University's sensor network of 30 weather stations located in and around the city of Wageningen
