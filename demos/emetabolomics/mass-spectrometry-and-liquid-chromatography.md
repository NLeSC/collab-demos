_How liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry can help understand molecular structure_

Liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry techniques are useful in identifying what molecules are present in a given sample. The process by which this happens may seem a bit complex if you're not familiar with the subject, so for the sake of the explanation, let's simplify the problem a bit by focusing solely on the mass spectrometry first.

Mass spectrometers aim to measure the mass of individual molecules. Because measuring the mass of something so small is diffucult, mass spectrometers employ a neat trick: instead of measuring the mass directly, they first charge the molecule (so-called _ionization_) and subsequently send it through a constant magnetic field. Because the molecule has been charged, its trajectory won't be a straight line but instead will be a curve. Assuming a unit charge, a lighter molecule's trajectory will be more curved than a heavier molecule's trajectory. When the molecule hits the _detector_ at the end of its trajectory, a lighter molecule will hit near the bottom of the detector, whereas a heavier molecule will hit nearer the top. This way, you can now use position along the detector surface as a measure of the molecule's mass.

So for example, if we introduce methane (CH4) into the apparatus, the mass spectrum will show a peak at a mass of about 16.04 (because Carbon's molecular mass is 12.01 and Hydrogen's molecular mass is 1.008), like so:

Note that the horizontal axis is labeled _M/z_, the mass-over-charge ratio. This is because it's not guaranteed that the molecule has unit charge (although usually it does). The vertical axis is a measure of how abundant a given mass is. 

It's likely that the mass spectrum will have multiple peaks. This is due to the fact that the molecule may fall apart into so-called _fragments_. For example, a methane molecule can fragment into into one CH2 molecule and one H2 molecule. If this happens, the mass spectrum will show two additional peaks:

The fragmentation of CH4 into CH2 and H2 occurs about 1 in 5 times, hence the relative height of the peaks at 2.02 and 14.03 are about 20% of the height of the peak at 16.04.
