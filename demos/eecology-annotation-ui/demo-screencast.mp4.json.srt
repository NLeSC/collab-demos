1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
start with an empty webapp, only show Timeline and Annotation (both collapsed)

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mouseover Tracker dropdown: each bird has a tracker id. We'll use 355, a Lesser black backed gull a.k.a a seagull

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mouseover 'From' calendar: select 2010-06-28

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mouseover 'From' time: select 00:00:00

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mouseover 'To' calendar: select 2010-06-29

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mouseover 'To' time: select 06:00:00

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mouseover Timeline: expand Timeline

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
click Load tracker button

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Expand timeline

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The bird has different behavior at different times: the colors show what each behavior is

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Expand the Annotations widget

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let's see how those annotations come to be

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let's look at the gray area, which represents the bird sitting on the ground

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If a bird is sitting on the ground you expect both its speed and its altitude to be low

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let's visualize some additional tracker data to see if that is true

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mouseover 'Windows' button

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Check 'speed'

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So the speed is low for this time period

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let's add altitude

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mouseover 'Windows' button, check 'altitude'

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So altitude is also low for this time period.

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But it's a bit difficult to see, let's make it bigger

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maximize altitude widget

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The blue line represents GPS altitude

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The blue area represents the altitude based looking up the surface elevation at the bird's location

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They are very close. Ergo the bird is sitting on the ground

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But wait there is more

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
These little gray lines...

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mouseover Timeline plot gray lines

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
...mean that an accelerometer measurement was taken at that time.

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let's look at the data

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
string

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
string

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
string

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
string

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
string

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
string
