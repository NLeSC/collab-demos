1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,000
start with an empty webapp, only show Timeline and Annotation (both collapsed)

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Mouseover Tracker dropdown: each bird has a tracker id. We'll use 355, a Lesser black backed gull a.k.a a seagull

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Mouseover 'From' calendar: select 2010-06-28

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Mouseover 'From' time: select 00:00:00

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Mouseover 'To' calendar: select 2010-06-29

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Mouseover 'To' time: select 06:00:00

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Mouseover Timeline: expand Timeline

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
click Load tracker button

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
...wait for data to load...

10
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The bird has different behavior at different times: the colors show what each behavior is

11
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
...a so-called 'annotation', such as 'flapping' or 'sitting'

12
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The second row is 'Timepoints' -- we'll get to that in a minute

13
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Expand the Annotations widget

14
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
A chronological list of how the bird behaved...

15
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
...corresponding to the data in the graph.

16
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Let's take a closer look at this gray area, which represents the bird sitting on the ground.

17
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
If a bird is sitting on the ground you expect both its speed and its altitude to be low

18
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Let's visualize some additional tracker data to see if that is true.

19
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Mouseover 'Windows' button

20
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Check 'speed'

21
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So the speed is low for this time period

22
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:58,000
<font color="#ff0000"><i>Never mind this part, there's a bug here</i></font>

23
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
The important part is that the speed is close to zero at this time.

24
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Let's add altitude

25
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So altitude is also low for this time period.

26
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:35,000
But wait there is more...

27
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
These little gray lines...

28
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
...mean that an accelerometer measurement was taken at that time.

29
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Let's look at the accelerometer data.

30
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Accelerometer measurements are taken in bursts of a few seconds, using an increased measurement frequency.

31
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
The lower widget shows the 6 bursts closest to the current time.

32
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Accelerometer shows acceleration in 3-D.

33
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Coincidentally, the sensor is oriented almost exactly horizontal when the bird is sitting.

34
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You can see this in the acceleration data: green is vertical...

35
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
...which registers about 1.0 G...

36
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
...while the other axes register about 0.0 G.
