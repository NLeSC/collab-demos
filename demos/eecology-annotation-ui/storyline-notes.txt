- interface can be used to generate annotations based on environment variables and bird behavior 
   - Q why do we want to annotate?
- select a bird and a time frame
- open the GoogleMap|Cesium map
- open the timeline widget; note the red slider
- slide the slider back and forth note how the current position in the map changes
- let try to get a better understanding of the bird's behavior by opening some additional variables
  - open altitude widget
  - open speed widget
  - open temperature widget
- (TODO find interesting place/behavior where auxiliary variables help explain the bird's behavior)
- besides the more or less continuous variables we've seen so far, we also have bursts of accelerometer measurements taken at very short intervals (up to ~60Hz, for 1 or 2 seconds). Bursts of accelerometer measurements are indicated by the thin gray lines in the timeline widget. The 6 bursts that are nearest the current position of the timeslider can be visualized separately in the Accelerometer widget
- use the accelerometer data to create an annotation for (say) floating on the waves
- Q: can you then use the annotation to find other places in the data that exhibit the same behavior; if so, how?

maybe also show the reverse:
load classes that somebody already created
