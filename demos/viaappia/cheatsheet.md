There are 4 modes of operation. Navigation, zooming, and changing the viewing direction works a little bit different in each mode:

1. On rails (cowboy icon): In this mode, the camera is on rails, therefore the only defined movement is along the railway tracks. The viewing direction and zoom level can be changed as well.
2. Free fly (helicopter icon): This is the most permissive mode.
3. Demo mode (play icon): This mode is basically the same as 'On rails' mode, except that the movement along the railway tracks does not require user input. The movement is from Northeast to Southwest, and the speed varies a little bit along the way.
4. Object inspection mode (no icon): This mode is different from all the other modes, because all camera movement is defined relative to the object of interest. When you're in 'Free fly' or in 'On rails' mode, holding the right mouse button down to change the viewing direction does not move the camera, but in this mode it does. That is why this mode is sometimes referred to as 'orbital mode'.

Below is a table with an overview of the controls. I'm using the following abbreviations for the buttons

- ``LMB``: left mouse button
- ``MMB``: middle mouse button
- ``RMB``: right mouse button


Via Appia controls per mode:

| Button | On rails | Free fly | Demo mode | Object inspection mode |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ``LMB`` | - | - | - | hold to rotate around the selected object |
| ``MMB`` | zoom in/out | zoom in/out | zoom in/out, also determines the speed of movement | zoom in/out |
| ``RMB`` | hold to change viewing direction (left/right/up/down) | hold to change viewing direction (left/right/up/down) | - | pan left/right/up/down |
| ``w`` | move southeast (independent of viewing direction) | move forward in 3-D along the viewing direction vector | - | - |
| ``a`` | - | move left (horizontally) | - | - |
| ``s`` | move northwest (independent of viewing direction) | move backward in 3-D along the viewing direction vector | - | - |
| ``d`` | - | move right (horizontally) | - | - |
| ``q`` | - | move up | - | - |
| ``z`` | - | move down | - | - |
