# General idea of the project

The [Via Appia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appian_Way) was the main highway connecting ancient Rome to Greece and the East. Its total length was more than 500 km running al the way to modern-day [Brindisi](https://www.google.nl/maps/place/Brindisi+BR,+Italy/@40.6422249,17.9009354,7z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x13467a3bc980ec6d:0x110cef7cc03daf9). Over time, many funeral monuments were erected along the street. Currently there is an effort underway to catalogue all of these monuments. Previously, this was mostly done using [Geographical Information Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system) (GIS), but the inherent 3-D nature of archaeology requires a different solution. For example, questions such as _Did this block of tufa come from that funeral monument down the road?_ are difficult to answer in GIS software, because it is not very well suited for viewing 3-D geometries. Alternatively one could measure the block in the field and measure the object the block is thought to originate from. However, this is a lot of work, and it is only feasible when it's known which block and which monument need to be measured. 


# Usage

# Known quirks

User controls are not what you expect (issue #11) and vary with the mode of viewing (of which there are 4):

1. On rails (cowboy icon)
2. Free fly (helicopter icon)
3. Demo mode (play icon)
4. Object inspection (no icon)

I've included a [cheatsheet](/cheatsheet).
